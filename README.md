# Shock Number Formats
A simple but life altering change to the way large numbers can be handled on your server. Converting numbers in the suffixed format, for example:
- `1.1B` to `1100000000`
- `1.5M` to `1500000`
- `6.8k` to `6800`

## Compatibility
This project should be compatible with any server running Paper, Spigot, or Bukkit. On any version (theoretically) from 1.8 to 1.20.2. However, it has only been tested on 1.20.2 and 1.20.1. ALL plugins which do not use a packet-level command framework should be supported automatically.

## Installation
1. Install Shock Number Formats
2. Install PacketEvents
3. Restart, dont reload.
4. Enjoy!
